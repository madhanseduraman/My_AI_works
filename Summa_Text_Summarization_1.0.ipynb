set up of the portfolio and how it will operate (Create phase), the prioritisation and selection of the initiatives which will deliver on an organisationâ€™s strategy (Select) and a high level validation of the capacity to deliver (Plan).\\nHowever, oversight of portfolio initiatives delivery is still required from an overall portfolio perspective.\\nWhen the portfolio transitions into the delivery phases, the PPM activities are related to monitoring and reviewing the status and performance of the selected portfolio initiatives.\\nPortfolio Definition and Initial Setup\\nConfirm and Prioritise Portfolio Initiatives\\nPlan Portfolio Execution\\nAssess Portfolio Performance and Recalibrate\\nHow an organisation will structure their portfolio(s),\\nHow the portfolio will be governed,\\nOnce the portfolio is established and operational, the ongoing Create phase becomes the review and confirmation of the portfolio setup and the ongoing execution of the demand management process and allocation to the relevant portfolio.\\nPortfolio Definition and Initial Setup\\nConfirm and Prioritise Portfolio Initiatives\\nPlan Portfolio Execution\\nAssess Portfolio Performance and Recalibrate\\nDetermine portfolio organisation\\n1.1 Determine portfolio organisation\\nEvery organisation will have a different level of PPM maturity and experience in how they manage their portfolios.\\nHowever at the individual portfolio level, depending on the initiative types that make up the portfolio there may be unique characteristics which require additional considerations and data for how that portfolio is setup, managed and tracked with respect to the entire portfolio lifecycle.\\nThe demand management proposal intake process (process step 1.3.1 Capture Demand) including approval requirements is developed and executed at the enterprise level to provide a single entry point and consistent process for progressing an idea through to an initiative in a portfolio.\\nThe initiative Workflow Phases and approval requirements (process step 1.1.2 Define Portfolio Structure and Workflow Phases) however, are developed and executed at the individual portfolio level as each portfolio may have unique requirements.\\nDuring the determine portfolio organisation process, it will be determined:\\nHow all the organisationâ€™s initiatives both in progress and proposed fit within the defined portfolio(s),\\nThe portfolio workflow phases that will be used for tracking and governing initiatives through the portfolio lifecycle.\\nHow regularly the portfolio review and planning process should be conducted both within and across portfolios\\nAs part of setting up the portfolio, an organisationâ€™s appetite for strategic risk should be assessed to provide additional guidance in determining investment allocations and whether proposed and current initiatives have a risk profile that is acceptable to the organisation in trying to achieve its strategic business objectives.\\nRelated Process Steps: 1.1.2 Define Portfolio Structure and Workflow Phases, 1.3.1 Capture Demand\\n1.1 Determine portfolio \\x0borganisation Process Steps\\nReview existing portfolio/program/initiative setup and support structures i.e. PMOs\\nDraft initial portfolio design/approach based on organisational size, complexity and structure\\nPortfolio organisation evaluation\\nPortfolio organisation assessment\\nInitial Portfolio design\\nDetermine initiative data collection requirements to enable portfolio categorisation\\nConduct workshops with key stakeholders to design the portfolio workflow phases for tracking and governing initiatives through the portfolio lifecycle\\n1.1 Determine portfolio \\x0borganisation Process Steps (contâ€™d)\\nReview investment planning process, frequency (enterprise and individual portfolio) and guidelines\\nReview requirements, dependencies and timings for individual portfolio and organisational (cross portfolio) planning processes\\nValidate portfolio planning processes and frequency against industry benchmarks and organisational requirements\\nAssess portfolio risk\\n1.2 Define portfolio governance\\nThe governance framework and structure is established to define the way the organisational assets and resources are planned to be managed within the portfolio according to the specific environment of the organisation.\\nThe framework establishes and tailors the decision-making rights and authorities, responsibilities, rules, and protocols needed to manage progress based on portfolio risk towards the achievement of their organisational strategy and objectives.\\nPortfolio governance is defined and established to make decisions about investments and priorities for the portfolio and ensures the PPM processes are followed to sustain the organisation.\\nThe portfolio governing body is made up of one or more individuals with the requisite authority, knowledge, and experience to ensure the alignment of portfolio initiatives with organisational strategy.\\nThe governing body has the authority to evaluate the portfolio performance and to make resourcing, investment, and priority decisions as needed.\\nThe reporting requirements in terms of content and frequency are a key element in monitoring the overall portfolio status and informing the decision making process.\\nRecommendations to the governing body requiring decisions may include new portfolio initiatives, the suspension or change of existing portfolio initiatives, and the reallocation of resources among portfolio initiatives.\\nGate reviews are set up as part of the overall portfolio governance process to act as controls for:\\nProgressing an initiative through the portfolio lifecycle

be developed specifically to satisfy an individual portfolioâ€™s unique requirements.\\nA prioritised list of business drivers is one of the enablers of portfolio analysis and optimisation.\\nIn order

investment, organisational affiliation, budget source, cost estimates, benefit estimates, risks, resource requirements and estimates, and strategic impact according the business drivers defined in 1.3

of initiatives are allocated and grouped according to the defined portfolio structure design and categories.\\nA review of the collected initiative data is also performed to validate that the information is complete and of a sufficiently high quality from a portfolio data requirements perspective.\\nSo whilst an initiative may have passed through the proposal intake process and a portfolio decision has been made to progress the initiative, subsequent project stage gates may also need organisational approval prior to moving through to delivery.\\nThese stage gates can be accommodated in

demand management process, the assessment needs to be validated across the portfolio for consistency purposes and in relation to the other initiatives.\\nOnce the prioritised list of portfolio initiatives is generated, portfolio constraints are then taken into consideration and various scenarios of the resulting initiatives are analysed.\\nThe optimal list of initiatives which delivers the

Real-time reporting and analytics of financial data enables faster reaction times and better anticipation of risks.\n",

    "In our experience, time spent debating the optimal transformation approach is time spent standing still. \n",
    "Often, the best transformation approach is whichever one an organisation is already familiar with and that reflects organisational culture and ways of working. If necessary, it can be tweaked and improved while delivering.\n",
    "We have built these three keys to success into our proposed approach and our up-front investment in a facilitated Design Studio session with key thought leaders. PTO.\n",
    "Transformations that don’t move at pace don’t achieve as much – they deliver benefits more slowly and often fall victim to change weariness before reaching their objective.\n",
    "The keys to transforming at pace are (i) avoiding common pitfalls, (ii) starting with the answer, and (iii) leveraging what already works.\n",
    "In our experience, transformation at pace cannot be sustained once a programme becomes reactive. It is critical to proactively ask the right questions up front.\n",
    "Is the transition to business partnering a simple a matter of capacity or will it require new information, skills, tools and ways of working? What changes are required to the finance operating model (processes, systems organisation or possible outsourcing) to drive greater strategic business partnering? \n",
    "What do your customers think about the service and the value currently delivered by Finance and Commercial? What do they need? What  do they expect to need in the future.\n",
